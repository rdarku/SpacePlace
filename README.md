<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Space Place Project
* Space Place was developed as a team to fill the ongoing need of renting spaces which could take the form of a house, a small place such as a playground, a room, an office space.   With COVID-19 and so much working from home currently in the world, we felt there was a need that exists in which more and more people are needing to find a place just to share such as an office space to get away from there everyday location even for a few hours. 

* Space Place was tested using Swagger and Sentry.IO.    Trello was such a huge part of this project for our team.  Trello allows the team to share thoughts, stay organized, come up with user stories, epics, cards, and action items.  Our team used Trello to show each task needed to be completed each day along with future plans.   

* As a team we came up with custom graphics for our design, custom API end points, and documentation that can show the advantages of using this API.

<!-- DIRECTIONS -->
## Directions
1. Clone the project from GitHub
2. Open up Visual Studio and open the .sln file
3. Set the start up project as Space Place.WebAPI
4. There is not seed data so this data would be needed first.  Amenities, Categories, Spaces, and Renters must be added.
5.  Create requirements in 4 using APIs themselves.
6.  Swagger can be used to run through each table and test each item.
7.  Swagger Client Interface - Swagger front end is available at baseurl/swagger
